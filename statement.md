Project Statement: Console Shopping Cart

Problem Statement

In a world increasingly reliant on digital transactions, even the most basic data entry tasks require structured handling. The problem this project addresses is the need for a simple, interactive tool to collect a list of commercial items and their values, calculate the aggregated cost, and display a clear summary. This simulates the fundamental logic required in any digital point-of-sale or e-commerce application.

Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is limited to a single-session, console-based application.

The application will:

Accept item names and prices interactively from the user.

Store this data in memory (using Python lists).

Perform the aggregation (summation) of the prices.

Output the list of items and the final total price to the console.

The application will not include: user authentication, database integration, persistent storage, external libraries, advanced quantity tracking, discounts, or tax calculation.

Target Users

The primary target users are:

Beginner Python Students: Individuals learning basic programming concepts (loops, lists, input/output).

Developers needing a lightweight calculation tool: Anyone requiring quick, list-based item summation without needing a full-featured spreadsheet or database.

High-Level Features

Interactive Item Entry: Simple, repetitive inputs for item/price pairs.

Termination Command: Easy exit from the input mode (q).

Basic Input Robustness: Handling for non-numeric price data.

Final Tally Output: Clear display of the total cost.
